# PORTFOLIO-PROJECT-Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Banks-using-Logistic-Regression

This personal project is a Data Modelling project with Logistic Regression. In this project, a Customer Churn Prediction Model was built for Banks using Logistic Regression. The aim of the model was to predict given certain
customers features, if that customer would be likely to leave (churn) the bank or not.

To accomplish this, the dataset contained the following information on each customer;
- 'RowNumber': A sequential index assigned to each row
- 'CustomerId': A unique serial key for each customer
- 'Surname': The customer's surname
- 'CreditScore': The customer's credit score
- 'Geography': The country of the customer
- 'Gender': The gender of the customer
- 'Age': The age of the customer
- 'Tenure': The number of years the customer has been with the bank
- 'Balance': The current balance in the customer's account
- 'NumOfProducts': The number of banking products the customers has with the bank
- 'HasCrCard': Whether or not the customer has a credit card with the bank
- 'IsActiveMember': Whether or not the customer is an active member of the bank
= 'EstimatedSalary': The estimated salary of the customer
- 'Exited': Whether or not the customer has churned (1 if they did, 0 if they did not)

All the following information was collected and preprocessed. The preprocessed data was then used to train a logistic regression model that could accurately predict customer churn. The model built will serve as a useful tool for banks to identify customers who are at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.
